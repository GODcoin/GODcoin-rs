## What is GODcoin?

GODcoin is the official currency of Christ. GODcoin is backed by physical gold
assets. The digital token name is represented as GRAEL. A single token will be
represented by a gram of gold.

For more information see the [whitepaper](https://godcoin.gold/whitepaper).

## Development

This project is intended to replace the Typescript implementation of the core
blockchain for GODcoin. At the current stage, this software is considered
experimental and under heavy development. Components are changing on a daily
basis so documentation will be minimal until the software stabilizes.

### Prerequisites

- Rust compiler
- libsodium

### Getting started

Make sure the source code is locally available by either cloning the repository
or downloading it.

Run the test suite:
```
$ cargo test
```

Launch GODcoin:
```
$ cargo run
```
